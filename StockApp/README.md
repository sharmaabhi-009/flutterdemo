## üìà Stock Auto Producer (Solace + Node.js)

This Node.js application auto-generates stock prices and publishes updates every 5 seconds to Solace PubSub+ topics using MQTT.

The stocks are from NSE and BSE exchanges, with realistic random price movements (maximum ¬±15% from the original price).

üöÄ How It Works

20 Stocks are preloaded (10 from NSE and 10 from BSE).

Each stock has:

symbol

name

sector

price

exchange (NSE/BSE)

The app publishes to dynamic topics like:
```bash
Stock/NSE/bank/equities/SBI
Stock/BSE/energy/equities/RELIANCE
```
üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
go to the directry in a new terminal and run
```bash
npm install
node server.js
```
It will run until it's not stopped from the terminal
